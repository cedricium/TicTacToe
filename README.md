# TicTacToe
### Three in a row: a fun, two player Terminal-based game written in C++.

This game was created to help me practice using C++ over my winter break. It isn't perfect, and that's the point. As I continue learning C++, I plan on optimizing the game and making the code more clear and concise as I go. Feel free to fork this repository and edit the game how you please.
